### What is Drum Corps?

**Drum Corps** is an activity popular amongst band kids that is essentially professional marching band. In order
to participate, a performer must audition at one of the many corps hosted by _Drum Corps International_ (DCI). If a 
contract to participate is awarded to said performer, they must then sacrifice their entire summer (the usual 
season for DCI) to attend spring training and tour. World class tours can run through the entirety of July, and 
end between August 8-10th, at DCI World Championships in Indianapolis. You can participate in Drum Corps until 
you "age out" at 21.

To newcomers, this whole concept must seem strange. 
Why sacrifice a whole summer for band?
Why pay so much money to compete? 
How competitive are these groups?

To clarify, here is a video of Carolina Crown's 2018 show [_Beast_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3x4TrnzuyU)

There are two competitive pools that Corps can compete in. These include World Class and Open Class.
Here are some corps from both divisions!

#### World Class Corps
* Blue Devils
* Carolina Crown
* Cavaliers
* Troopers

#### Open Class Corps
* Colt Cadets
* Legend
* River City Rhythm
* Gold

#### My experience with Drum Corps

I marched Drum Corps with the Colt Cadets in 2019. Our show was titled "Of a Feather" and was about birds. 
I have since gone on to participate in indoor drumline, and now university band. I am auditioning again
this year, and hope to spend my summer with the Troopers Drum and Bugle Corps!
