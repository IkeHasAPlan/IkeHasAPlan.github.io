### What is Drum Corps?

**Drum Corps** is an activity popular amongst band kids that is essentially professional marching band. In order
to participate, a performer must audition at one of the many corps hosted by _Drum Corps International_ (DCI). If a 
contract to participate is awarded to said performer, they must then sacrifice their entire summer (the usual 
season for DCI) to attend spring training and tour. World class tours can run through the entirety of July, and 
end between August 8-10th, at DCI World Championships in Indianapolis. You can participate in Drum Corps until 
you "age out" at 21.

To newcomers, this whole concept must seem strange. 
Why sacrifice a whole summer for band?
Why pay so much money to compete? 
How competitive are these groups?

To clarify, here is a video of Carolina Crown's 2018 show _Beast_
