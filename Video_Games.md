## Video Games and my Childhood

For as long as I can remember, video games have always been a huge part of my life. Growing 
up, I would play on my brother's hand me down gameboy color. I would play Tetris, Pokemon 
Blue, Ninja Turtles, and so much more. I got an Xbox 360 when I was 12, and I've fallen more
in love since.

Obviously now, as an adult, I don't have as much time for video games. However, this doesn't
mean I don't still FIND time to indulge. When I do, I strictly game on my PC these days. 
At the moment, most of my game time is spent in Overwatch, Hearthstone, or most recently
Diablo II Resurrected (I like Blizzard if you can't tell :)).

### Some of my favorite games include:
* Starcraft II
* Bioshock
* Terraria
* Minecraft

## What's with the obsession with Blizzard?

My brothers hooked me onto Blizzard games growing up, and I spent all of High School wishing to 
one day work for them. While I've moved on from that dream these days, I would be lying if I
said there wasn't a part of me that would still love to work for them these days.
