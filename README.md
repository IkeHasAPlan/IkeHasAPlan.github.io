### About me:
I am an undergraduate engineering student at the _University of Missouri_. I am working towards my bachelors degree 
in information technology. I am heavily involved with Marching Mizzou here at MU, and am a proud member of the university snare line!

My hometown is **St. Joseph. Missouri**, where I attended Central High School. St. Joseph ('Joetown' for locals) is the biggest small 
town you'll ever visit! With a population of 75,000, people can usually be seen walking around our recently renovated Felix Square, 
exploring the beautiful Krug Park, or catching a bite to eat in one of our many locally owned small businesses. The town is extremely 
historic, with many locals claiming it had the potential to be bigger than Kansas City (if it weren't for that darn railroad being built
through KC instead)!

It's a small town, yes, but it's my home and I love it with all my heart.

While in High School, I spent a year and a half working retail at my local TJ Maxx. I was mostly a sales floor associate, but I eventually 
worked my way up to becoming a Customer Experience Coordinator, which is essentially a shift leader for cashiering. I saved up lots during
the summer, and am currently inbetween occupations.

I am the youngest of 7 (yes 7!), and I am looking forward to see where my career takes me :)
